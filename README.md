Poster-Example
==============

This project is an example of a LaTeX poster using the [sciposter](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sciposter/) class which emphasises the usage of native LaTeX fonts, figures created using TiKZ and PGF, and demonstrates a variety of these packages with references and links to manuals and package websites.

It includes a TeXlipse project for inclusing into Eclipse.

To install LaTeX, I recommend TexLive:
* [Linux and Windows](http://www.tug.org/texlive/)
* [Mac](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)

As an editor, I recommend Eclipse with the TeXlipse plugin:
* [Eclipse IDE for Java Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
* [TeXlipse](http://texlipse.sourceforge.net/) plugin
